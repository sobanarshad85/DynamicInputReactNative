# DynamicInputReactNative
# iAuditor

This is awesome repository, here you can find the code how to manage dynamic inputs coming from server/backend/API.

In the application I used local state as a dummy, if you update that dummy through an api where inputs tags, like textField, radio Button, dropDown is coming, Appliation automatically will render that form.

By using this repository you can create dynamic forms.

someone back from server want to render 2 inputTextFields and 3 radioButton and 1 dropdown he can now render it from server.

Hope you like it
